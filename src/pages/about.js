        <p className="about-me">
          I am a Web Developer with a strong engineering background who is
          currently studying at Springboard and graduating at the end of May. I
          am proficient in in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, Node,
          Express, Redux, Jasmine, Jest and other front and backend
          technologies. I'm looking for a position where I will be able to grow
          my burgeoning skill set by solving difficult problems to deliver
          impressive results. When I'm not focused on developing my skills as a
          software engineer you can often find me hiking on some part of the
          Appalachian Trail or in the kitchen making dinner for my family or
          baking them a loaf of sourdough bread. If you're looking for someone
          with these skills and a strong motivation to succeed please don't
          hesitate to get it touch.
